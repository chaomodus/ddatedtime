Cklok is a Discordian clock for practical Discordian time keeping.

Cklok has no time zones, and is pinned to GMT-8:00 (POEE Stardand Time).

Cklok divides the day into 10 equal parts known as periods, numbered 1 to 10, each 8640 seconds long. These
periods have names: Laan, Piit, Jiid, Voox, Zuul, Sooz, Ziim, Naar, Tlaat.

Each period is divided into 5 equal sessions, numbered 1 to 5, each 1728 seconds long. These sessions have
names, Tlof, Tluc, Notl, Thoz, and Civ.

Each session is divided into 50 moments, numbered 0 to 49 each about 58 seconds long.
Each moment is divided into 100 centimoments numbered 0 to 99 each about 0.6 seconds long.

Time may presented purely as numbers, such as:

5'2:24.49

Or with words and numbers such as:

Zuul Tluc:24.49


It may also be displayed as an analogue time piece. The disc of the face is divided into 10 equal parts such that a short arrow hand can indicate
the period. Every other period mark is highlighted, and swept by the longer session hand.. Each session is divided into 10 small points for even longer,
pointier moment hand. A fine centimoment hand sweeps the face for each moment.
