KLOQUE ODD# 3933333333333-1/7
-----------------------------

This time system is synchronized to local solar noon (that is, the
point of the day at which the sun is highest in the sky). It divides
the times between solar noons into 10 equal parts (sessions),
numbered, from noon, 0 through 5, and then -4 though 0. Session 5 may
be shown as +/- 5 since it is +5. Day changes happen at +/-5.

Each session is further divided into 10 blocs (numbered 0..9), which
are again divided into 30 moments (numbered 0..29).

Approximate conversions:

Session - 4.8 hours (17280 seconds)
Bloc - 28.8 minutes (1728 seconds)
Moment - 57.6 secontds

THese conversions assume a 24 hour (86400 second) civil day.

The Kloque is displayed in digital form thus:

[-]S:BB.MM

Such as:

-3:05.23

In analogue form, divide a circle into 10 equal segments (a regular decagon),
with vertexes at the top and bottom position. Divide the 10 segemnts into
3rds. A slender hand sweeps these 3rds to indicate moments. A long, wide
arrowed hand sweeps the vertexes to indicate the bloc. A short, flattened
hand sweeps the vertexes to indicate the session.

For practical reasons, civil noon may be substituted for solar noon, since
under many circumstances civil noon is available but solar noon isn't as
readily so (such as watches or clocks without positional data or solar
detection devices).
