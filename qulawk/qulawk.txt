Qulock
======

A Discordian Clock for Discordian time keeping. Pronounced 'clock'.

1 std day is composed of
  5 sessions (4.8 std hours / 17280 std seconds)
    of 5 periods (0.96 std hours / 3456 std seconds)
      of 25 bits (2.3 std minutes / 138 std seconds)
         of 25 moments (5.52 std seconds) (moments may be divided further if finer time gradients are required, for example into 25 littlemoments of 0.2208 std seconds each)

formatting:

s:t:b.m

example, midday is approximately

2:2:12.13

Alternatively we can name each session:

  Hypnos, Hemera, Aether, Hesperides, Nyx

And we can name each period within the sessions:

  Geef, Lep, Shad, Kwok, Zin

and thus midday is:

Hemera Lep'12.13

Qulock is synchronized to POEE Standard Time (PST), which is fixed to UTC-8. Qulock may be used in local times too but this is nonstandard.
